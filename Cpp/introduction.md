# Introduction

## Learning C++

+ Language features exist to support a variety of programming styles and techniques. Consequently, the task of learning a language should focus on mastering the native and natual styles for that language - not on understanding of every little detail of every language feature.
+ Fundamental application concepts are representedas abstractions(e.g.,classes, templates, and class hierarchies) in libraries. Many of the most fundamental progrmming concepts are represented in the standard library. Thus, learning the standard library is an integral part of learning C++.
+ The purpose of learning a programming language is to become a better programmer, that is, to become more effective at designing and implementing new systems and at maintaining old ones. For this, an appreciation of programming and design techniques is far more important than understanding all the details. The understanding of technical detals comes with time and practice.
