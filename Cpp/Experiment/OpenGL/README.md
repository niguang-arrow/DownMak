# Some OpenGL examples

They are not written by me, I keep them here only for reference.

To run these examples, you must first install `freeglut`, `glfw3`, and `opencv`;
However some examples need `freeglut` while others `glfw3`.

You can install `freeglut` in Ubuntu use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```

As for `glfw3`, you can refer to [http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile_guide.html#compile_deps_x11](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile_guide.html#compile_deps_x11),
and install it. Maybe you need also run: `sudo apt-get install xorg-dev`.

And install `opencv` is a little tricky, so I don't talk about it here.
