# make

## Introduction

```
target: prerequisite
	recipe
	...
```

+ A *target* is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as 'clean'.

+ A *prerequisite* is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends on several files.

+ A *recipe* is an action that **make** carries out. A recipe may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its own line. **Please note:** you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line! You can set **.RECIPEPREFIX** variable to an alternate character.

+ A *rule* explains how and when to remake certain files which are the targets of the particular rule. **make** carries out the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target. A rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action.

+ Targets that do not refer to files but are just actions are called *phony targets*. For example, 'clean'.

  ```
  clean:
  	rm main main.o object.o \
  		defs.o others.o
  ```
